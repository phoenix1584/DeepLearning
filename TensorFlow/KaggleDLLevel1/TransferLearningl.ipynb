      "source": "# Exercise Introduction\n\nThe cameraman who shot our deep learning videos mentioned a frustrating problem that we could solve with deep learning.  \n\nHe offers a service that scans photographs and slides to store them digitally.  He uses a machine that quickly scans many photos. But depending on the orientation of the original photo, many images are digitized sideways.  He currently spends a lot of time looking find which photos need to be rotated sideways, so he can fix them.\n\nIt would save him a lot of time if this process could be automated.  In this exercise, you will build a model that distinguishes which photos are sideways and which are upright.\n\nIf you were going to sell this service commercially, you might use a large dataset to train the model. But we'll have great success with even a small dataset.  We'll work with a small dataset of dog pictures, half of which are rotated sideways.\n\nSpecifying and compiling the model look the same as in the example you've seen. But you'll need to make some changes to fit the model.\n\n# 1) Specify the Model\n\nSince this is your first time, you won't yet be able to create this from scratch. \n\nWe've filled in most of the code you'll need, but left some critical pieces blank.  \n\nFill in the blanks (marked with `____`) in the  code below. Then uncomment those lines and run the cell.\n"
